# Conway's Game of Life in Prog8

To run this sample, you need the [Prog8 compiler](https://prog8.readthedocs.io/).

Then, run the following command:

For C64:

```shell
prog8 -t c64 main.p8
```

For Commander X16:

```shell
prog8 -t cx16 main.p8
```

Then, run the resulting `main.prg` file in your favorite emulator.
