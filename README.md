# Conway's Game of Life in Prog8


To run this sample, you need the [Prog8 compiler](https://prog8.readthedocs.io/).

Then, run the following command:

For C64:

```shell
prog8 -t c64 -o life.prg life.p8
```

For Commander X16:

```shell
prog8 -t cx16 -o life.prg life.p8
```

Then, run the resulting `life.prg` file in your favorite emulator.
